🧠 Stroke Lesion Segmentation from DWI Scans

This repository contains the full preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training pipeline for stroke lesion segmentation using both machine learning (Random Forest and XGBoost) and deep learning (EfficientNet-B2 U-Net) approaches.

The framework was developed to automate ischemic stroke lesion segmentation on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), improving reproducibility and facilitating quantitative research in stroke assessment.
